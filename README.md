**Tech Stack**: Next.js, React, Typescript, TailwindCSS

**Project tidbit**: 
- This is an interactive website submission for Track 2 of [Codedex’s Summer ’24 Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/hackathon).
- The main features is are an animated envelope that opens to reveal content on click, draggable elements that can be freely moved around, and an embedded Google Map via [Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview)

**Future Considerations**: 
- Making interface more user-friendly and adaptable across multiple screen views (currently works best on full web view).
